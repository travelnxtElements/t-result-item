The data in this element helps the user to make a purchase decision so information necessary to enable that must form part of this element. This may include
- Price, flight timings may be primary information while airline name, duration, class of travel, number of stops may be additional information to be displayed.
- Certain tertiary information may also be displayed like duration and place of stops, aircraft details, marketing airline. The marketing airline needs to be mentioned if it is different from the operating airline or if mixed airlines operate the flight, i.e. different airlines operate different segments of the flight  
- Mentioning that a leg of the journey may be completed by train, along with its details
- Amenities Information: Availability of wi-fi, in seat entertainment options, power slot and charger

## Other Considerations
- Traditionally all these pieces of information can be layed out in cards, but an alternate arrangement to display flight search results can be a gantt chart view
- Clubbing of results with the same price is sometimes done by travel sites and may be considered as a means of reducing the total number of results
- Flight search results can be sorted by price, stops, duration, departure or arrival times, or airline
